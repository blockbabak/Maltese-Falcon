  <h1>The Maltese Falcon: A True Health Mystery</h1>
  <blockquote><em>“The stuff that dreams are made of.”</em><br>— <span>The Maltese Falcon</span>, 1941</blockquote>

  <p>In the film, the legendary Falcon turns out to be a fraud — a glittering decoy fought over by men who didn’t care who got hurt, as long as it wasn’t them.</p>

  <p>Sadly, this isn’t fiction.</p>

  <p><strong>I’m Babak Kamali</strong> — British citizen, semi-retired engineer, former CTO, diagnosed with ADHD and aortic valve disease long before arriving in Malta in 2015. What followed was a near-decade of medical negligence, indifference, and systemic evasion. Promises were made. Treatments delayed. Lives (mine) quietly placed at risk.</p>

  <p>It started with a malfunctioning medical implant. Then a worsening heart condition. What I got in return was not care — but avoidance. Bureaucrats vanished, doctors contradicted themselves, records went silent. And when challenged, the system seemed more concerned with <strong>cutting costs than saving lives</strong>.</p>

  <p>I now believe this is not just incompetence — but targeted <strong>victimization of a foreigner</strong> who dared to demand continuity of care. Had I been Maltese, I suspect this saga would’ve played out differently.</p>

  <h2>What This Site Contains</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="Heart-Story/Heart-Story.html">💔 Heart-Story</a>: My journey through cardiac neglect, contradictory diagnoses, and a quietly ticking clock.</li>
    <li><a href="Brain-Story/Brain-Story.html">🧠 Brain-Story</a>: The long silence around a medical device that should’ve been replaced or reactivated years ago — but wasn’t.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All claims are supported by emails, diagnostics, reports, and message logs — available on request. These stories are just the surface. The full evidence runs deeper.</p>

  <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
  <p>Because I’m running out of time — and options.</p>

  <p>I am seeking:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Urgent intervention</strong> from anyone with reach into UK or EU healthcare oversight.</li>
    <li><strong>Referral or legal assistance</strong>, ideally from a UK-based professional with the courage to cut through the red tape.</li>
    <li><strong>Awareness</strong>, because silence enables what documentation now makes clear: this is a <strong>systemic failure</strong>, hidden behind well-dressed forms and polite deflection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>A Note to British Readers</h2>
  <p>If you think the NHS is broken, Malta’s system is what happens <em>after</em> the breakage is institutionalized. Here, neglect is polite, smiling, and quietly deadly.</p>
