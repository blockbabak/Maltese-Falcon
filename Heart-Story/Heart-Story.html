  <h1>Story of My Heart</h1>

  <p>Dear Dr Demarco,</p>
  <p><strong>1.</strong> Following the reading of your previous email, last night I found myself too upset to sleep. That is even more so than usual, which has been a problem for me since 2016, as I repeatedly referred to.</p>
  <p><strong>2.</strong> If you can not be bothered to read all the text then please let me forewarn you of the conclusion behind reasonings of the text that follow below: I need a nurse or assistant, private or not can be determined at some later stage.</p>
  <p><strong>3.</strong> I got up this morning in a state of rage and decided to lay everything out for everyone to see, including on Facebook and share with all the relevant or interested parties as well as LinkedIn and send a copy to lawyers in England a starting point for a possible investigation should any of my family decide to take action after my death.</p>
  <p><strong>4.</strong> I am simply flabbergasted that you, despite having witnessed my level of immobility in the hospital when I first met you for an ECG and the subsequent Echocardiogram, seem unaware of the level of physical and mental fatigue I am dealing with.</p>
  <p><strong>5.</strong> I constantly misplace my reading glasses along with my medication, which I then forget to take on time. This is not to mention all the other daily tasks that a healthy and well-rested individual takes for granted.</p>
  <p><strong>6.</strong> The only person who is SUPPOSED to help me is a cleaner, who when I returned from the hospital last time, was found to have taken my wallet as well as having locked my dog in the bathroom. When the wallet was finally returned, €300.00 was missing. She insisted that she only took €150 and promised to return it the next day that never ever came to pass. No doubt in her kindness he had not anticipated my return from the hospital EVER.</p>
  <p><strong>7.</strong> She doesn't speak English very well, and along with her daughter and son, she has an absurd notion of time-based arrangements that is not consistent with a scientific understanding of time. Her son has let me down so many times that I avoid interacting with him. For example, his mother brought him over without my request, and he promised to take the CDs containing my medical data—which I explicitly requested not be on a CD or DVD—to be transferred onto a medium from which I could make copies available to several parties simultaneously through a shared, read-only online folder on the internet.</p>
  <p><strong>8.</strong> It is important to emphasize here that due to the long length of each file, a normal copy or the usual transfer process is not suitable. It requires specific software to maintain the fidelity of these files and the upload. This is why I was worried about involving this gentleman who, in the past, has proven to have an inclination for taking shortcuts whenever it suits his pocket.</p>
  <p><strong>9.</strong> However, I need not have worried. True to form, he did not turn up. His mother's excuse was that he had gone to Malta without first bothering to inform me or even indicate a time for his return. This is why I gave up on the idea altogether and decided to search for a suitable local company on my own. This proved more difficult than anticipated because of:</p>
  <p><strong>10.</strong> My inability to sleep and wake up at predictable times.</p>
  <p><strong>11.</strong> The summer heat, which makes it difficult for me to drag myself to my vehicle at any time past the early morning hours.</p>
  <p><strong>12.</strong> The somewhat unconventional opening and closing hours here, and a bizarre reluctance to engage in technical conversation by firms who do answer their telephone number as listed online, which is not always the case. Many of these numbers have never been updated, remaining yet another source of frustration.</p>
  <p><strong>13.</strong> The above factors have resulted in still not having been able to pass the first step of this process—a process I had hoped the Maltese Health System would anticipate instead of handing me two CDs, one of which has more data than I requested, thereby adding to the complexity and the cost of the enterprise.</p>
  <p><strong>14.</strong> The other name that has been a source of confusion and worry preventing me from falling sleep  during last night is Mr. Schembri.</p>
  <p><strong>15.</strong> I may be mistaken, but I thought you knew that I know Mr. Schembri and met him in 2017 at Mater Dei Hospital. At the time, he was introduced to me as the person heading the VNS department that was yet to be organized. It was Mr. Schembri who confidently told me that once he had arranged the team, he would be able to replace my VNS implant later that same year. We even discussed a timeline, and I sent him the list of my medications and sought authority from the billing section for a free-of-charge procedure, since at the time the U.K. was still a member of the EU and Article 50 would not have taken effect until the end of 2020.</p>
  <p><strong>16.</strong> However, I never heard another word from Mr. Schembri again, despite my repeated requests for an explanation. I even found an email address for him on LinkedIn. Assuming he was under orders not to respond to any of my emails, I thought a personal Gmail address would bypass the health system. In my email, I simply asked for explanation; I even offered to have coffee somewhere of his choice so that he could tell me what happened and why the organized procedure suddenly disappeared from the records. I wanted to suggest that perhaps he could complete what he had promised privately, or at least activate the device that I had already replaced at my own cost in Prague. In my mind for no reason other  that cruelty Total SILENCE was his reaction.</p>
  <p><strong>17.</strong> The only explanation that I could make was to base his silence on a medieval island culture  where outsiders are not trusted and affairs can only proceed through personal associations.</p>
  <p><strong>18.</strong> I finally met a doctor who claimed to know Mr. Schembri personally, and I asked him to relay my request. Unfortunately and despite all  my attempts to explain at the time, Dr. Sciberras's mistake was to ask Mr. Schembri to contact me directly, which I knew he wouldn't.  As usual, I had to prove as I seem to have to everyone here, which meant waiting two more weeks of yet more SILENCE. In the middle of the third week, I convinced Dr. Sciberras to ask him directly and then pass on the response.</p>
  <p><strong>19.</strong> I am obviously not privy to the totality of the communication between the two gentlemen, but the information that I finally received was to contact the neurologist Dr. Malcolm Vella. This left me with a question, the answer to which has eluded me to this day. I can only view it as part of the same culture that often manifests itself in people without their own awareness. Otherwise, why not repeat the same sentence to me directly in an SMS or email, both of which would have prevented any immediate request for elaboration on my part? Then he could have gone back to his true and tested habit of total silence, couldn't he?</p>
  <p><strong>20.</strong> What I found out later was even less comprehensible. According to Dr. Malcolm Vella, VNS in Malta is to be used for the treatment of epilepsy only, and after EIGHT years, they have still not been able to assemble a team. Meanwhile, Europe has moved on, using VNS for a variety of cases, as I compiled in my research paper and showed Dr. Sciberras to convince him to contact Mr. Schembri.</p>
  <p><strong>21.</strong> Please correct me if I am wrong: It was you, wasn't it, who explained to me in the hospital, while examining the sonar output after the end of the TEE earlier that same afternoon, who said that for this type of surgery, patients are sent abroad? You mentioned the U.K., most probably because of the historical connection and shared language that should inevitably simplify the administrative and communication aspects of the process.</p>
  <p><strong>22.</strong> Again, please correct me if I misremember again but isn't it the case that unlike larger countries like the UK, smaller countries such as Malta don't have adequate demand for such complex surgeries to make the needed investment in training and accumulation of experience viable. Isn't this why such surgeries are referred abroad? If that is the case, then why does my case appear to be exempted contrary to your own initial suggestion.</p>
  <p><strong>23.</strong> Don't you think that the only explanation for sudden change of approach is simply the extra COSTS involved? If not what other explanations  could be?</p>
  <p><strong>24.</strong> I also hope you appreciate why I find the choice of Mr. Schembri for my surgery is particularly unsuitable and a profoundly traumatic.</p>
  <p><strong>25.</strong> Isn't there anyone to standup for the law and patient's right here?</p>
  <p><strong>26.</strong> Wasn't COSTS the same reason why the replacement of my VNS device didn't go ahead in 2017? Why wasn't I sent abroad or at least informed of this option when the head of Mount Carmel Hospital recommended for the surgery to go ahead. He could very well have read the same case study that I quoted, and indeed I sent him a copy of it myself later but it seems the matter had already been taken out of his hands and true to form he too never responded to any of my emails.</p>
  <p><strong>27.</strong> ISN'T THE WHOLE THING OBVIOUS ENOUGH?</p>
  <h2>PART 2</h2>
  <p>This is only one part of the story of the last nine years. What I found out from other interactions is even more terrifying. Back in 2018 and having failed with Mr. Schembri, I approached a psychiatrist called Dr. David Cassar, first privately and then through Gozo Hospital. At the time, because of the pain  I was forced to walk on crutches, but my mental state was also affected, manifesting in anomia. For example, I couldn't remember the name of the medication branded as 'Stilnoct' that I had already tried along with many others in my attempt to fight insomnia.</p>
  <p>Dr. Cassar found this irritating rather than diagnosing it as a subsequent symptom of the acute insomnia I was suffering from. He proceeded to lecture me as a way of inducing what is known as the placebo effect, and charged me €90.00 in return for a prescription for an over-the-counter antihistamine, despite having been told that I had already tried antihistamines. Of course, I couldn't have known the brand name in advance, otherwise I would not have bothered to take the prescription to the pharmacy. But once I did, I still tried it. Whether it was the role placebo farce  pathetically played by Dr Cassar walking up and down his office like rhythmically as if to hypnotize me or my prior experience, as usual it worked for one night and then stopped working completely, like all the other 1st and 2nd generation antihistamines I had tried before.</p>
  <p>I wish that was the end of my dealings with Dr. Cassar, but it only ended when I decided that he is a dangerous, narcissistic psychopath who I hope has not yet developed a taste for human flesh, or Gozo would have its own homegrown Hannibal Lecter.</p>
  <p>This was demonstrated to me when, having known that I was diagnosed with ADHD but had stopped taking my stimulants to better my chances of falling asleep, he prescribed Olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic drug) as proposed by his sidekick, whose name I have thankfully forgotten.</p>
  <p>Their somewhat bizarre understanding of pharmacokinetics based their reasoning on the fact that Olanzapine was sometimes prescribed for children with ADHD. However, it seems that the CONCOMITANT prescription of stimulants had missed their attention, having no bearing on the issue for this pair. They had not bothered to read my medical history either, which includes an episode of being hospitalized for having been prescribed Olanzapine before I was diagnosed with ADHD.</p>
  <p>They had either not read the notes I had prepared for them, or they had decided beforehand that this was all part of a "junkie's theatre" to trick them, not even considering that I would be asking for something stronger than Xanax if I wanted to get high.</p>
  <p>They even refused the official diagnosis by an ADHD specialist who was a teaching professor at the University of Sussex. The letter confirmed that I was a known volunteer in a research group arranged by the medical school to study ADHD further, and I had been diagnosed before I was accepted as a volunteer. Instead, his sidekick insisted on re-diagnosing me with ADHD based on a thesis that had been debunked twenty years prior, i.e., that some children "grow out of" their ADHD. They didn't even consider that my ADHD was not diagnosed during my childhood but in my early 40s.</p>
  <p>I am afraid it didn't end there. I refused to remain their patient on several occasions and insisted that I would choose who treated my ADHD, preferring to seek a private specialist. Even after that, I was hesitant to return to stimulants precisely because the interruption in my sleep had increased my heart rate, and having had an aortic valve replacement, I was careful not to stress my heart. This is why, when the narcoleptic symptoms became too much, I tried to use the off-label medication Modafinil. However, by then, the distribution of Modafinil was passed on to hospitals in Malta. This is why I had to approach Gozo hospital again and crossed paths with the dynamic duo, who tried to prevent the renewal of an existing prescription. Fortunately, this time the head of the department accepted the copy of my diagnosis from the team at the Medical School of the University of Sussex, and Dr. Cassar and his sidekick were overruled.</p>
  <p>In conclusion I would also like to reiterate that it is obvious that this obscene preoccupation with money has meant that cost is the ultimate arbitrator in any decision and has probably been a contributor to the zombification of the system to the level that it no longer makes sense.</p>
  <p>This is why I must redraw your attention back to the critical questions raised in paragraphs 16  and 17 of this letter. and repeat my request for a formal, official, and definitive response ASAP.</p>
  <p>Thanking you for your kind attention and awaiting your response I remain,</p>
  <p>Yours sincerely</p>
